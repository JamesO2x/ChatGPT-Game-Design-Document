# ChatGPT Game Design Document
 Creating a game design document entirely from ChatGPT results.


## Here's a basic prompt format:

---

Thanks. Next, can you please write the section of our game design document titled "10.2 Future plans and potential expansions.".

Remember these points:

- You MUST use a markdown code block so I can easily copy/paste the contents.
- We are writing a game design document for the game Chrono Trigger. Only use info relevant to Chrono Trigger.
- Write as if the game hasn't been released yet and you are pitching this idea to an executive. So don't use phrases like "Chrono Trigger was" as if talking in past tense. Make sure to write from the perspective of someone working on the game before it was released.
- Write from a 1995 perspective. Try not to reference modern technology or events past 1995, unless it specifically improves the flow of the document.
- If necessary, use a sub numbering system. For example, starting with 6.1.1, then 6.1.2, etc.
