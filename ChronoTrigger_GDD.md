# Chrono Trigger: Game Design Document

> This document was initially generated by the Large Language Model ChatGPT (3.5 version) on 2023.03.25. Sections 6 to 10 were generated on 2023.04.18. As a result of using an LLM, some information may not be factually accurate. Regardless, the broader analysis provided by such a document may still prove to be insightful in its own right.
>
> Some sections with glaring factual errors, I've added a line with "CORRECTION" labeling it as so. This way the original output and correction are both present.
> 
> To create this document, I first asked ChatGPT to generate a table of contents for a game design document based on Chrono Trigger for the SNES. After it typed out the table of contents, I simply went through each item in the list one by one, and asked it to generate the text for that section.
> 
> Some minor adjustments were made, such as numbering the sections correctly. But the actual content of each section is largely unaltered by me. I also made the executive decision to ask it to present certain sections in the form of a table or list (when appropriate) instead of paragraphs. But again, I did not manually alter the contents of the tables it generated.
>
> Like any game design document, its always possible to expand and add more information to any section, and the document itself is truly never "complete", but merely in an adapting state of "good enough" for the purposes of conveying the themes needed to finish production.
>
> In the case of a study like this, the game in question has already been completed and shipped. It's possible that this document could be further expanded to get into the nitty gritty details. As of now, this document is merely an example of the encyclopedic knowledge of ChatGPT, and its unique ability to synthesize information into interesting ways that human beings may not have previously attempted to do.
>
> Of course, its also woth mentioning that ChatGPT would not be able to create such an extensive document as this if it weren't for all of the amazing human beings who have filled the internet with walk-throughs, strategy guides, tips, tricks, hacks, blogs, developer interviews, and analysis of Chrono Trigger. It is thanks to them that GPT is even able to contain all this information to synthesize and extrapolate from.

> Without further ado, here is the result:

As characters defeat enemies in battle, they gain experience points (EXP) that contribute towards leveling up. Upon reaching a new level, characters receive stat boosts and sometimes learn new Techs and spells.

### 2.3.2 Tech Points and Techs

Tech Points (TP) are earned in battle and allow characters to perform powerful techniques, or "Techs," that can deal heavy damage or have special effects. As characters use their Techs more frequently, they may also learn new and stronger Techs.

### 2.3.3 Equipment and Items

3\. Gameplay
============

3.1 Battle System Mechanics
---------------------------

### 3.1.1 Overview

Chrono Trigger's battle system is turn-based, with battles taking place on a separate screen from exploration. Players can have up to three characters in their active party, with additional characters being swapped in and out at save points. The battle system is designed to be accessible to both newcomers and veterans of the RPG genre, with several unique mechanics that set it apart from other RPGs.

The objective of each battle is to defeat all enemies while keeping the party alive.

### 3.1.2 Actions

Characters take turns performing their chosen action in order of their speed stat, which is affected by equipment and certain abilities. Enemies also have their own turns and will attack the player characters with physical or magical attacks.

During battle, each character has a variety of actions they can take, including:

-   Attack: A basic physical attack that deals damage to the enemy.
-   Techs: Special abilities unique to each character that use MP (magic points) to execute. Techs can range from healing abilities to powerful damage-dealing attacks.
-   Items: Consumable items that can heal or buff the party, or damage or debuff the enemy.
-   Defend: A defensive action that reduces damage taken for that turn.
-   Run: An option to escape the battle, though this may not always be successful.


### 3.1.3 Techs

One of the most unique features of Chrono Trigger's battle system is the use of "Techs," special abilities that are unique to each character and can be unlocked and upgraded over time. Techs can range from powerful single-target attacks to healing spells to status-inflicting abilities.

#### Dual/Triple Techs

One of the unique features of the battle system in Chrono Trigger is the ability for characters to combine their Techs into more powerful Dual or Triple Techs. 

As players progress through the story, they will unlock "Dual Techs" and "Triple Techs," which are powerful abilities that require two or three characters to perform. These Techs can deal massive damage to enemies, heal the party, or inflict status ailments. To use a Dual or Triple Tech, players must have the necessary characters in their active party and have their Techs leveled up to a certain point.

These require specific combinations of characters and Techs to execute, such as Crono's Lightning Tech combining with Marle's Ice Tech to create a powerful dual attack.

### 3.1.4 Active Time Battle (ATB)

Chrono Trigger's battle system uses an ATB gauge to determine turn order. Each character and enemy has an ATB gauge that fills up over time, and when it reaches the maximum, they can take their turn. However, the gauge can also be interrupted or delayed by enemy attacks or certain Techs.

### 3.1.5 Status Effects

Enemies and characters can inflict a variety of status effects on each other, such as Sleep, Poison, or Confuse. These effects can have a variety of negative impacts on the affected character, such as reduced accuracy or inability to act, and can be cured using items or certain Techs.

Different enemies are weak to different status effects, and some bosses can even inflict multiple status effects at once, making it important for players to have a variety of status-healing items and spells on hand.

### 3.1.6 Experience and Leveling Up

After battles, characters gain experience points (EXP) based on the enemies defeated and their level of participation in the battle. When a character reaches a certain amount of EXP, they level up, increasing their stats and occasionally learning new Techs.

### 3.1.7 Boss Battles

Boss battles in Chrono Trigger often require different strategies than regular battles. Bosses may have multiple forms or phases, unique abilities or weaknesses, or even require puzzle-solving or environmental interaction to defeat. Boss battles often require careful planning and use of Dual/Triple Techs to deal enough damage.

### 3.1.8 New Game+

After completing the game once, players can access a "New Game+" mode, which allows them to start the game over with their party and equipment from the previous playthrough. This mode also unlocks additional endings and hidden content that can only be accessed by completing certain objectives.

### 3.1.9 Conclusion

Overall, Chrono Trigger's battle system is designed to be both accessible and deep, with a variety of unique mechanics and strategies for players to explore. The use of Techs, Dual Techs, and Triple Techs encourages players to experiment with different party compositions and playstyles, while the inclusion of status effects and different enemy weaknesses adds an element of strategy to battles.

To achieve this, we will be using a combination of original sound effects and library sounds. Our sound design team will work closely with the creative director and the game designers to ensure that each sound effect is appropriate for the game's setting and gameplay mechanics.

Some of the sound effects that will be used in Chrono Trigger include:

- Weapon and spell sounds: Each character in the game has unique weapons and spells, and we will create sounds that are specific to each of them. For example, Crono's sword will have a distinct sound when swung, and Marle's ice magic will have a unique audio effect.
- Environmental sounds: We want to immerse players in the game's world, so we will create a variety of environmental sounds, such as the sound of waves crashing on the shore or the rustling of leaves in the forest.
- UI sounds: Our user interface will have sounds that correspond to different actions, such as selecting a menu item or using an item in the inventory. These sounds will be designed to be both informative and satisfying to the player.

Overall, we aim to create a cohesive and immersive soundscape for Chrono Trigger that enhances the player's experience and complements the game's visuals and music.

6.2 Music composition
---------------------

In Chrono Trigger, music plays an important role in setting the tone and enhancing the player's emotional connection to the game's story and characters. We have commissioned a team of talented composers to create an original soundtrack that complements the game's time-traveling adventure and brings its world to life.

The soundtrack features a total of 60 tracks, including overworld and battle themes, character and location-specific music, and variations for different time periods. Each track has been crafted to reflect the mood and atmosphere of the game's various settings, from the prehistoric past to the distant future.

The team of composers for Chrono Trigger includes:

- Yasunori Mitsuda
- Nobuo Uematsu
- Noriko Matsueda

These composers are well-known for their work on other classic RPGs and bring a wealth of experience and creativity to the project.

6.3 Voice acting (if applicable)
--------------------------------

Chrono Trigger does not include voice acting, as it was not a common feature in video games at the time of its development. All dialogue and character interactions are presented through text boxes. The lack of voice acting allows players to fully immerse themselves in the game's world and focus on the story and gameplay mechanics without being distracted by external voices.

However, sound effects play a critical role in immersing the player in the game's world. From the clang of swords in battle to the chirping of birds in the forest, the sound effects in Chrono Trigger bring the game's environments and characters to life. The sound design is carefully crafted to enhance the game's overall mood and tone, helping to create an unforgettable experience for players.
