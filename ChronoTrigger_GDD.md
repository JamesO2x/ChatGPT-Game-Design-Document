# Chrono Trigger: Game Design Document

> This document was generated by the Large Language Model ChatGPT on 2023.03.25. As a result, some information may not be factually accurate. Regardless, the broader analysis provided by such a document may still prove to be insightful in its own right.
> 
> To create this document, I first asked ChatGPT to generate a table of contents for a game design document based on Chrono Trigger for the SNES. After it typed out the table of contents, I simply went through each item in the list one by one, and asked it to generate the text for that section.
> 
> Some minor adjustments were made, such as numbering the sections correctly. But the actual content of each section is largely unaltered by me. I also made the executive decision to ask it to present certain sections in the form of a table or list (when appropriate) instead of paragraphs. But again, I did not manually alter the contents of the tables it generated.
>
> Like any game design document, its always possible to expand and add more information to any section, and the document itself is truly never "complete", but merely in an adapting state of "good enough" for the purposes of conveying the themes needed to finish production.
>
> In the case of a study like this, the game is already been completed and shipped, its possible that this document could be further expanded to get into the nitty gritty details. As of now, this document is merely an example of the encyclopedic knowledge of ChatGPT, and its unique ability to synthesize information into interesting ways that human beings may not have previously attempted to do.
>
> Of course, its also woth mentioning that ChatGPT would not be able to create such an extensive document as this if it weren't for all of the amazing human beings who have filled the internet with walk-throughs, strategy guides, tips, tricks, hacks, blogs, and analysis of Chrono Trigger. It is thanks to them that GPT is even able to contain all this information to synthesize and extrapolate from.

### 1.1.2 Expanded Game Concept

Chrono Trigger takes place in a fantasy world where time travel is possible, and follows the story of a young man named Crono and his friends as they journey through different eras of history to prevent a catastrophic event from occurring.

The game concept revolves around a combination of time travel, adventure, and character-driven storytelling. Players take control of Crono and his party as they explore a variety of different environments, from ancient ruins to futuristic cities, in order to uncover clues and complete quests that will allow them to progress through the game's main storyline.

One of the key features of Chrono Trigger is its nonlinear narrative structure.

In terms of gameplay, Chrono Trigger features a turn-based battle system that emphasizes strategy and teamwork. Players can have up to three characters in their party at once, and can switch characters in and out during battle.

Overall, Chrono Trigger is designed to offer players a rich and immersive RPG experience that combines exploration, storytelling, and strategic gameplay. With its nonlinear narrative structure, emphasis on character development and interaction, and unique time travel mechanics, Chrono Trigger is designed to appeal to players who are looking for a deep and engaging RPG experience.

This platform will enable us to reach a wider audience and provide a convenient and accessible way for players to experience the game.

1.3 Story synopsis

### 2.3.2 Tech Points and Techs

3\. Gameplay
============

3.1 Battle System Mechanics
---------------------------

### 3.1.1 Overview

Chrono Trigger's battle system is turn-based, with battles taking place on a separate screen from exploration. Players can have up to three characters in their active party, with additional characters being swapped in and out at save points. The battle system is designed to be accessible to both newcomers and veterans of the RPG genre, with several unique mechanics that set it apart from other RPGs.

The objective of each battle is to defeat all enemies while keeping the party alive.

### 3.1.2 Actions

Characters take turns performing their chosen action in order of their speed stat, which is affected by equipment and certain abilities. Enemies also have their own turns and will attack the player characters with physical or magical attacks.

During battle, each character has a variety of actions they can take, including:

-   Attack: A basic physical attack that deals damage to the enemy.
-   Techs: Special abilities unique to each character that use MP (magic points) to execute. Techs can range from healing abilities to powerful damage-dealing attacks.
-   Items: Consumable items that can heal or buff the party, or damage or debuff the enemy.
-   Defend: A defensive action that reduces damage taken for that turn.
-   Run: An option to escape the battle, though this may not always be successful.


### 3.1.3 Techs

One of the most unique features of Chrono Trigger's battle system is the use of "Techs," special abilities that are unique to each character and can be unlocked and upgraded over time. Techs can range from powerful single-target attacks to healing spells to status-inflicting abilities.

#### Dual/Triple Techs

One of the unique features of the battle system in Chrono Trigger is the ability for characters to combine their Techs into more powerful Dual or Triple Techs. 

As players progress through the story, they will unlock "Dual Techs" and "Triple Techs," which are powerful abilities that require two or three characters to perform. These Techs can deal massive damage to enemies, heal the party, or inflict status ailments. To use a Dual or Triple Tech, players must have the necessary characters in their active party and have their Techs leveled up to a certain point.

These require specific combinations of characters and Techs to execute, such as Crono's Lightning Tech combining with Marle's Ice Tech to create a powerful dual attack.

### 3.1.4 Active Time Battle (ATB)

Chrono Trigger's battle system uses an ATB gauge to determine turn order. Each character and enemy has an ATB gauge that fills up over time, and when it reaches the maximum, they can take their turn. However, the gauge can also be interrupted or delayed by enemy attacks or certain Techs.

### 3.1.5 Status Effects

Enemies and characters can inflict a variety of status effects on each other, such as Sleep, Poison, or Confuse. These effects can have a variety of negative impacts on the affected character, such as reduced accuracy or inability to act, and can be cured using items or certain Techs.

Different enemies are weak to different status effects, and some bosses can even inflict multiple status effects at once, making it important for players to have a variety of status-healing items and spells on hand.

### 3.1.6 Experience and Leveling Up

After battles, characters gain experience points (EXP) based on the enemies defeated and their level of participation in the battle. When a character reaches a certain amount of EXP, they level up, increasing their stats and occasionally learning new Techs.

### 3.1.7 Boss Battles

Boss battles in Chrono Trigger often require different strategies than regular battles. Bosses may have multiple forms or phases, unique abilities or weaknesses, or even require puzzle-solving or environmental interaction to defeat. Boss battles often require careful planning and use of Dual/Triple Techs to deal enough damage.

### 3.1.8 New Game+

After completing the game once, players can access a "New Game+" mode, which allows them to start the game over with their party and equipment from the previous playthrough. This mode also unlocks additional endings and hidden content that can only be accessed by completing certain objectives.

### 3.1.9 Conclusion

Overall, Chrono Trigger's battle system is designed to be both accessible and deep, with a variety of unique mechanics and strategies for players to explore. The use of Techs, Dual Techs, and Triple Techs encourages players to experiment with different party compositions and playstyles, while the inclusion of status effects and different enemy weaknesses adds an element of strategy to battles.
